## 1. Resource Consumption Analysis

### Compute Power Impact

The unauthorized mining operations consumed significant computational resources:

- **Average System CPU Utilization:** {{printf "%.1f" .AvgSystemCPUUsage}}%
- **Peak CPU Utilization Observed:** {{printf "%.1f" .PeakSystemCPUUsage}}%
- **Total CPU-Hours Consumed:** {{printf "%.2f" .TotalMiningHours}} hours
- **Mining Type Distribution:**

  - Hybrid CPU+GPU: {{.MinersWithHybrid}} systems

**Impact:** Mining operations typically maximize processor utilization, severely degrading performance for legitimate workloads. Systems experiencing >80% CPU usage would have experienced significant slowdowns, delayed processing times, and poor user experience.

### Electricity Consumption

- **Total Energy Consumed:** {{printf "%.2f" .TotalEstimatedKWh}} kWh
- **Estimated Cost:** ${{printf "%.2f" .TotalEstimatedCost}} (at ${{printf "%.3f" .ElectricityCostPer}} per kWh)
- **Daily Average:** {{printf "%.2f" .DailyAvgKWh}} kWh/day (${{printf "%.2f" .DailyAvgCost}}/day)

**Methodology:** Energy estimates based on average CPU power consumption of {{printf "%.0f" .CPUPowerWatts}}W and GPU power consumption of {{printf "%.0f" .GPUPowerWatts}}W under sustained load, adjusted for actual CPU utilization percentages.

**Impact:** Continuous high-utilization operations result in substantial electricity costs. This represents pure waste, as the computational work provided no business value.

### Network Impact

- **Total Blocks Mined:** {{.TotalBlocksMined}}
- **Mining Pool Connections:** Persistent connections to external mining pool infrastructure
- **Data Transfer:** Ongoing work requests and solution submissions

**Impact:** While mining is not extremely bandwidth-intensive, it generates persistent outbound connections that may have bypassed security monitoring and created potential data exfiltration channels.

## 3. Infrastructure Damage Assessment

### Hardware Wear and Lifespan Impact

Sustained high-utilization mining operations accelerate hardware degradation:

**Component Stress:**
- **Processors (CPU/GPU):** Running at maximum load for {{printf "%.2f" .TotalMiningHours}} total hours
- **Cooling Systems:** Fans running at maximum speed to dissipate heat
- **Power Supplies:** Operating under continuous high load
- **Motherboards:** Sustained high current draw through VRM components

**Expected Lifespan Reduction:**
- Normal enterprise hardware lifespan: 5-7 years
- Estimated lifespan reduction from sustained mining: 20-40%
- Accelerated replacement costs for {{.TotalMiners}} affected systems

### Thermal Stress

**Risk Factors:**
- Sustained high temperatures degrade silicon and solder joints
- Increased risk of thermal shutdowns and component failure
- Potential for thermal paste degradation requiring maintenance
- Systems with GPU mining ({{.MinersWithGPU}} systems) face additional thermal stress

**Recommendation:** All affected systems should undergo thermal inspection and preventive maintenance, including thermal paste replacement and cooling system verification.

- Systems should be forensically analyzed for additional malware or backdoors
- Network traffic logs should be reviewed for data exfiltration attempts
- All affected systems require credential rotation and security hardening
